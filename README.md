# HelloTriangle-DX12
This is a self-study project that I worked on for a week at my study at Breda University of Applied Sciences.
The goal is to get a vertex colored triangle on screen using DirectX 12, while learning about all the concepts that are used.
Everything is written in one `.cpp` file, most of which in the `main()` function. It sets up everything we need for DirectX 12, and then goes into the main rendering loop at the end of the main function.
